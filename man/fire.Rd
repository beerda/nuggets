\title{Obtain truth-degrees of conditions}
\usage{
fire(x, condition, t_norm = "goguen")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix or data frame containing predicate truth values. If \code{x} is
a matrix, it must be numeric (double) or logical. If \code{x} is a data frame,
all columns must be numeric (double) or logical.}

\item{condition}{A character vector of conditions, each formatted according
to \code{\link[=format_condition]{format_condition()}}. For example, \code{"{p1,p2,p3}"} represents a
condition composed of three predicates \code{"p1"}, \code{"p2"}, and \code{"p3"}. Every
predicate mentioned in \code{condition} must be present as a column in \code{x}.}

\item{t_norm}{A string specifying the triangular norm (t-norm) used to
compute conjunctions of predicate values. Must be one of \code{"goedel"}
(minimum t-norm), \code{"goguen"} (product t-norm), or \code{"lukas"} (≈Åukasiewicz
t-norm).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with entries in the interval \eqn{[0, 1]} giving
the truth degrees of the conditions. The matrix has \code{nrow(x)} rows and
\code{length(condition)} columns. The element in row \emph{i} and column \emph{j}
corresponds to the truth degree of the \emph{j}-th condition evaluated on the
\emph{i}-th row of \code{x}.
}
\description{
Given a data frame or matrix of truth values for predicates, compute the
truth values of a set of conditions expressed as elementary conjunctions.
}
\details{
Each element of \code{condition} must be a character string of the format
\code{"{p1,p2,p3}"}, where \code{"p1"}, \code{"p2"}, and \code{"p3"} are predicate names. The
data object \code{x} must contain columns whose names correspond exactly to all
predicates referenced in the conditions. Each condition is evaluated for
every row of \code{x} as a conjunction of its predicates, with the conjunction
operation determined by the \code{t_norm} argument. An empty condition (\code{"{}"})
is always evaluated as 1 (i.e., fully true).
}
\examples{
d <- data.frame(
  a = c(1, 0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 0),
  b = c(0.5, 1, 0.5, 0, 1),
  c = c(0.9, 0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.7)
)

# Evaluate conditions with different t-norms
fire(d, c("{a,c}", "{}", "{a,b,c}"), t_norm = "goguen")
fire(d, c("{a,c}", "{a,b}"), t_norm = "goedel")
fire(d, c("{b,c}"), t_norm = "lukas")
