\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix or data frame with data to search in.}

\item{f}{the callback function to be executed for each generated condition.
The arguments of the callback function differ based on the value of the
\code{type} argument (see below):
\itemize{
\item If \code{type = "crisp"} (that is, boolean),
the callback function \code{f} must accept a single argument \code{pd} of type
\code{data.frame} with single (if \code{yvars == NULL}) or two (if \code{yvars != NULL})
columns, accessible as \code{pd[[1]]} and \code{pd[[2]]}. Data frame \code{pd} is
a subset of the original
data frame \code{x} with all rows that satisfy the generated condition.
Optionally, the callback function may accept an argument \code{nd} that
is a subset of the original data frame \code{x} with all rows that do not
satisfy the generated condition.
\item If \code{type = "fuzzy"}, the callback function \code{f} must accept an argument
\code{d} of type \code{data.frame} with single (if \code{yvars == NULL}) or two (if
\code{yvars != NULL}) columns, accessible as \code{d[[1]]} and \code{d[[2]]}, and
a numeric argument \code{weights} with the same length as the number of rows
in \code{d}. The \code{weights} argument contains the truth degree
of the generated condition for each row of \code{d}. The truth degree is
a number in the interval \eqn{[0, 1]} that represents the degree of
satisfaction of the condition in the original data row.
}
In all cases, the function must return a list of scalar values, which
will be converted into a single row of result of final tibble.}

\item{condition}{a tidyselect expression (see
\href{https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/syntax.html}{tidyselect syntax})
specifying the columns to use as condition predicates. The selected
columns must be logical or numeric. If numeric, fuzzy conditions are
considered.}

\item{xvars}{a tidyselect expression (see
\href{https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/syntax.html}{tidyselect syntax})
specifying the columns of \code{x}, whose names will be used as a domain for
combinations use at the first place (xvar)}

\item{yvars}{\code{NULL} or a tidyselect expression (see
\href{https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/syntax.html}{tidyselect syntax})
specifying the columns of \code{x}, whose names will be used as a domain for
combinations use at the second place (yvar)}

\item{disjoint}{an atomic vector of size equal to the number of columns of \code{x}
that specifies the groups of predicates: if some elements of the \code{disjoint}
vector are equal, then the corresponding columns of \code{x} will NEITHER be
present together in a single condition NOR in a single combination of
\code{xvars} and \code{yvars}. If \code{x} is prepared with
\code{\link[=partition]{partition()}}, using the \code{\link[=var_names]{var_names()}} function on \code{x}'s column names
is a convenient way to create the \code{disjoint} vector.}

\item{excluded}{NULL or a list of character vectors, where each character vector
contains the names of columns that must not appear together in a single
condition.}

\item{allow}{a character string specifying which columns are allowed to be
selected by \code{xvars} and \code{yvars} arguments. Possible values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"all"} - all columns are allowed to be selected
\item \code{"numeric"} - only numeric columns are allowed to be selected
}}

\item{na_rm}{a logical value indicating whether to remove rows with missing
values from sub-data before the callback function \code{f} is called}

\item{type}{a character string specifying the type of conditions to be processed.
The \code{"crisp"} type accepts only logical columns as condition predicates.
The \code{"fuzzy"} type accepts both logical and numeric columns as condition
predicates where numeric data are in the interval \eqn{[0, 1]}. The
callback function \code{f} differs based on the value of the \code{type} argument
(see the description of \code{f} above).}

\item{min_length}{the minimum size (the minimum number of predicates) of the
condition to be generated (must be greater or equal to 0). If 0, the empty
condition is generated in the first place.}

\item{max_length}{the maximum size (the maximum number of predicates) of the
condition to be generated. If equal to Inf, the maximum length of conditions
is limited only by the number of available predicates.}

\item{min_support}{the minimum support of a condition to trigger the callback
function for it. The support of the condition is the relative frequency
of the condition in the dataset \code{x}. For logical data, it equals to the
relative frequency of rows such that all condition predicates are TRUE on it.
For numerical (double) input, the support is computed as the mean (over all
rows) of multiplications of predicate values.}

\item{max_support}{the maximum support of a condition to trigger the callback
function for it. See argument \code{min_support} for details of what is the
support of a condition.}

\item{max_results}{the maximum number of generated conditions to execute the
callback function on. If the number of found conditions exceeds
\code{max_results}, the function stops generating new conditions and returns
the results. To avoid long computations during the search, it is recommended
to set \code{max_results} to a reasonable positive value. Setting \code{max_results}
to \code{Inf} will generate all possible conditions.}

\item{verbose}{a logical scalar indicating whether to print progress messages.}

\item{threads}{the number of threads to use for parallel computation.}

\item{error_context}{a list of details to be used in error messages.
This argument is useful when \code{dig_grid()} is called from another
function to provide error messages, which refer to arguments of the
calling function. The list must contain the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{arg_x} - the name of the argument \code{x} as a character string
\item \code{arg_condition} - the name of the argument \code{condition} as a character
string
\item \code{arg_xvars} - the name of the argument \code{xvars} as a character string
\item \code{arg_yvars} - the name of the argument \code{yvars} as a character string
\item \code{call} - an environment in which to evaluate the error messages.
}}
}
\value{
A tibble with found patterns. Each row represents a single call of
the callback function \code{f}.
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

This function creates a grid column names specified
by \code{xvars} and \code{yvars} (see \code{\link[=var_grid]{var_grid()}}). After that, it enumerates all
conditions created from data in \code{x} (by calling \code{\link[=dig]{dig()}}) and for each such
condition and for each row of the grid of combinations, a user-defined
function \code{f} is executed on each sub-data created from \code{x} by selecting all
rows of \code{x} that satisfy the generated condition and by selecting the
columns in the grid's row.

Function is useful for searching for patterns that are based on the
relationships between pairs of columns, such as in \code{\link[=dig_correlations]{dig_correlations()}}.
