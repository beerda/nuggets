\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix or data frame with data to search in.}

\item{condition}{a tidyselect expression (see
\href{https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/syntax.html}{tidyselect syntax})
specifying the columns to use as condition predicates}

\item{xvars}{a tidyselect expression (see
\href{https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/syntax.html}{tidyselect syntax})
specifying the columns to use for computation of correlations}

\item{yvars}{a tidyselect expression (see
\href{https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/syntax.html}{tidyselect syntax})
specifying the columns to use for computation of correlations}

\item{disjoint}{an atomic vector of size equal to the number of columns of \code{x}
that specifies the groups of predicates: if some elements of the \code{disjoint}
vector are equal, then the corresponding columns of \code{x} will NOT be
present together in a single condition. If \code{x} is prepared with
\code{\link[=partition]{partition()}}, using the \code{\link[=var_names]{var_names()}} function on \code{x}'s column names
is a convenient way to create the \code{disjoint} vector.}

\item{excluded}{NULL or a list of character vectors, where each character vector
contains the names of columns that must not appear together in a single
condition.}

\item{method}{a character string indicating which correlation coefficient is
to be used for the test. One of \code{"pearson"}, \code{"kendall"}, or \code{"spearman"}}

\item{alternative}{indicates the alternative hypothesis and must be one of
\code{"two.sided"}, \code{"greater"} or \code{"less"}. \code{"greater"} corresponds to
positive association, \code{"less"} to negative association.}

\item{exact}{a logical indicating whether an exact p-value should be computed.
Used for Kendall's \emph{tau} and Spearman's \emph{rho}. See \code{\link[stats:cor.test]{stats::cor.test()}} for
more information.}

\item{min_length}{the minimum size (the minimum number of predicates) of the
condition to be generated (must be greater or equal to 0). If 0, the empty
condition is generated in the first place.}

\item{max_length}{The maximum size (the maximum number of predicates) of the
condition to be generated. If equal to Inf, the maximum length of conditions
is limited only by the number of available predicates.}

\item{min_support}{the minimum support of a condition to trigger the callback
function for it. The support of the condition is the relative frequency
of the condition in the dataset \code{x}. For logical data, it equals to the
relative frequency of rows such that all condition predicates are TRUE on it.
For numerical (double) input, the support is computed as the mean (over all
rows) of multiplications of predicate values.}

\item{max_support}{the maximum support of a condition to trigger the callback
function for it. See argument \code{min_support} for details of what is the
support of a condition.}

\item{max_results}{the maximum number of generated conditions to execute the
callback function on. If the number of found conditions exceeds
\code{max_results}, the function stops generating new conditions and returns
the results. To avoid long computations during the search, it is recommended
to set \code{max_results} to a reasonable positive value. Setting \code{max_results}
to \code{Inf} will generate all possible conditions.}

\item{verbose}{a logical scalar indicating whether to print progress messages.}

\item{threads}{the number of threads to use for parallel computation.}
}
\value{
An S3 object which is an instance of \code{correlations} and \code{nugget}
classes and which is tibble with found patterns.

\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

Conditional correlations are patterns that identify strong relationships
between pairs of numeric variables under specific conditions.

\describe{
\item{Scheme:}{\code{xvar ~ yvar | C}\cr\cr
\code{xvar} and \code{yvar} highly correlates in data that satisfy the condition
\code{C}.}
\item{Example:}{\code{study_time ~ test_score | hard_exam}\cr\cr
For \emph{hard exams}, the amount of \emph{study time} is highly correlated with
the obtained exam's \emph{test score}.}
}

The function computes correlations between all combinations of \code{xvars} and
\code{yvars} columns of \code{x} in multiple sub-data corresponding to conditions
generated from \code{condition} columns.

\examples{
# convert iris$Species into dummy logical variables
d <- partition(iris, Species)

# find conditional correlations between all pairs of numeric variables
dig_correlations(d,
                 condition = where(is.logical),
                 xvars = Sepal.Length:Petal.Width,
                 yvars = Sepal.Length:Petal.Width)

# With `condition = NULL`, dig_correlations() computes correlations between
# all pairs of numeric variables on the whole dataset only, which is an
# alternative way of computing the correlation matrix
dig_correlations(iris,
                 condition = NULL,
                 xvars = Sepal.Length:Petal.Width,
                 yvars = Sepal.Length:Petal.Width)
