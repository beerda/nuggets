\title{Create a nugget object of a given flavour}
\usage{
nugget(x, flavour, call_function, call_data, call_args)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object with rules or patterns, typically a tibble or data frame.
If \code{NULL}, it will be converted to an empty tibble.}

\item{flavour}{A character string specifying the flavour of the nugget, or
\code{NULL} if no flavour should be assigned. If given, the returned object
will inherit from both \code{"nugget"} and the specified flavour class.}

\item{call_function}{A character scalar giving the name of the function that
created the nugget. Stored as an attribute for provenance.}

\item{call_data}{A list containing information about the data that was
passed to the function which created the nugget. Stored as an attribute
for reproducibility.}

\item{call_args}{A list of arguments that were passed to the function which
created the nugget. Stored as an attribute for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A tibble object that is an S3 subclass of \code{"nugget"} and, if
specified, the given \code{flavour} class. The object also contains attributes
\code{"call_function"} and \code{"call_args"} describing its provenance.
}
\description{
Construct a nugget object, which is an S3 object used to store and
represent results (e.g., rules or patterns) in the \code{nuggets} framework.

A nugget is technically a tibble (or data frame) that inherits from both
the \code{"nugget"} class and, optionally, a flavour-specific S3 class. This
allows distinguishing different types of nuggets (flavours) while still
supporting generic methods for all nuggets.
}
\details{
Each nugget stores additional provenance information in attributes:
\itemize{
\item \code{"call_function"} — the name of the function that created the nugget.
\item \code{"call_args"} — the list of arguments passed to that function.
}

These attributes make it possible to reconstruct or track how the nugget
was created, which supports reproducibility, transparency, and debugging.
For example, one can inspect \code{attr(n, "call_args")} to recover the original
parameters used to mine the patterns.

df <- data.frame(lhs = c("a", "b"), rhs = c("c", "d"))

            flavour = "rules",

                             nrow = 2,
                             colnames = c("lhs", "rhs")),
            call_args = list(data = "mydata"))
