# nuggets

<img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="360" />

`nuggets` is a package for [R statistical computing
environment](https://www.r-project.org/) providing a framework for
systematic exploration of **association rules** ([Agrawal
(1994)](https://www.vldb.org/conf/1994/P487.PDF)), **contrast patterns**
([Chen (2022)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2209.13556)), **emerging
patterns** ([Dong (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1145/312129.312191)),
**subgroup discovery** ([Atzmueller
(2015)](https://doi.org/10.1002/widm.1144)), and **conditional
correlations** ([HÃ¡jek
(1978)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-66943-9)). User-defined
functions may also be supplied to guide custom pattern searches.

Supports both **crisp** (Boolean) and **fuzzy** data. Generates
candidate conditions expressed as elementary conjunctions, evaluates
them on a dataset, and inspects the induced sub-data for statistical,
logical, or structural properties such as associations, correlations, or
contrasts. Includes methods for **visualization** of logical structures
and supports **interactive exploration** through integrated Shiny
applications.

## Key Features

- Support for both **categorical** and **numeric data**.
- Provides both **Boolean** and **fuzzy** logic approach.
- Data preparation functions for easy pre-processing phase.
- Functions for examining **associations**, **conditional
  correlations**, and **contrasts** among data variables.
- **Visualization** and pattern post-processing tools.
- Integrated Shiny applications for **interactive exploration** of
  discovered patterns.

## Documentation

Read the [full documentation of the nuggets
package](https://beerda.github.io/nuggets/).

## Installation

To install the stable version of `nuggets` from CRAN, type the following
command within the R session:

``` r
install.packages("nuggets")
```

You can also install the development version of `nuggets` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("beerda/nuggets")
```

To start using the package, load it to the R session with:

``` r
library(nuggets)
```

## Minimal Example

The following example demonstrates how to use `nuggets` to find
association rules in the built-in `mtcars` dataset:

``` r
# Preprocess: dichotomize and fuzzify numeric variables
cars <- mtcars |>
    partition(cyl, vs:gear, .method = "dummy") |>
    partition(carb, .method = "crisp", .breaks = c(0, 3, 10)) |>
    partition(mpg, disp:qsec, .method = "triangle", .breaks = 3)

# Search for associations among conditions
rules <- dig_associations(cars,
                          antecedent = everything(),
                          consequent = everything(),
                          max_length = 4,
                          min_support = 0.1,
                          measures = c("lift", "conviction"))

# Explore the found rules interactively
explore(rules, cars)
```
