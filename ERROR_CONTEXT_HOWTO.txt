Internal functions:
- the name must start with "."
- the function must not be exported
- the last argument of the function may be the `error_context` object, which
  is a list of the following elements:
  - names of arguments that appear in error messages initialized with the call
    of `caller_arg()` (e.g. `arg_x = caller_arg(x)`)
  - the `call` object pointing to caller's environment, `call = caller_env()`

Exported functions:
- these functions may be used by the user
- the function must be exported
- the last argument of the function may be the `error_context` object, which
  is a list of the following elements:
  - names of arguments that appear in error messages initialized to a string
    constant equal to a name of the argument (e.g.  `arg_x = "x"`)
  - the `call` object pointing to the current environment, `call = current_env()`
