#' Find tautologies or "almost tautologies" in a dataset
#'
#' This function finds tautologies in a dataset, i.e., rules of the form
#' `{a1 & a2 & ... & an} => {c}` where `a1`, `a2`, ..., `an` are
#' antecedents and `c` is a consequent. The intent of searching for
#' tautologies is to find rules that are always true, which may be
#' used for filtering of further generated conditions. The resulting
#' rules may be used as a basis for the list of `excluded` formulae
#' (see the `excluded` argument of [dig()]).
#'
#' The search for tautologies is performed by iteratively
#' searching for rules with increasing length of the antecedent.
#' Rules found in previous iterations are used as `excluded`
#' argument in the next iteration.
#'
#' @param x a matrix or data frame with data to search in. The matrix must be
#'      numeric (double) or logical. If `x` is a data frame then each column
#'      must be either numeric (double) or logical.
#' @param antecedent a tidyselect expression (see
#'      [tidyselect syntax](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/syntax.html))
#'      specifying the columns to use in the antecedent (left) part of the rules
#' @param consequent a tidyselect expression (see
#'      [tidyselect syntax](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/articles/syntax.html))
#'      specifying the columns to use in the consequent (right) part of the rules
#' @param disjoint an atomic vector of size equal to the number of columns of `x`
#'      that specifies the groups of predicates: if some elements of the `disjoint`
#'      vector are equal, then the corresponding columns of `x` will NOT be
#'      present together in a single condition. If `x` is prepared with
#'      [partition()], using the [var_names()] function on `x`'s column names
#'      is a convenient way to create the `disjoint` vector.
#' @param max_length The maximum length, i.e., the maximum number of predicates in the
#'      antecedent, of a rule to be generated. If equal to Inf, the maximum length
#'      is limited only by the number of available predicates.
#' @param min_coverage the minimum coverage of a rule in the dataset `x`.
#'      (See Description for the definition of *coverage*.)
#' @param min_support the minimum support of a rule in the dataset `x`.
#'      (See Description for the definition of *support*.)
#' @param min_confidence the minimum confidence of a rule in the dataset `x`.
#'      (See Description for the definition of *confidence*.)
#' @param measures a character vector specifying the additional quality measures to compute.
#'      If `NULL`, no additional measures are computed. Possible values are `"lift"`,
#'      `"conviction"`, `"added_value"`.
#'      See [https://mhahsler.github.io/arules/docs/measures](https://mhahsler.github.io/arules/docs/measures)
#'      for a description of the measures.
#' @param t_norm a t-norm used to compute conjunction of weights. It must be one of
#'      `"goedel"` (minimum t-norm), `"goguen"` (product t-norm), or `"lukas"`
#'      (≈Åukasiewicz t-norm).
#' @param max_results the maximum number of generated conditions to execute the
#'      callback function on. If the number of found conditions exceeds
#'      `max_results`, the function stops generating new conditions and returns
#'      the results. To avoid long computations during the search, it is recommended
#'      to set `max_results` to a reasonable positive value. Setting `max_results`
#'      to `Inf` will generate all possible conditions.
#' @param verbose a logical value indicating whether to print progress messages.
#' @param threads the number of threads to use for parallel computation.
#' @returns An S3 object which is an instance of `associations` and `nugget`
#'      classes and which is a tibble with found tautologies in the format equal to
#'      the output of [dig_associations()].
