#' Remove invalid conditions from a list
#'
#' From a given list of character vectors, remove those elements that are not
#' valid conditions.
#'
#' A valid condition is a character vector of predicates, where each predicate
#' corresponds to a column name in the supplied data frame or matrix. Empty
#' character vectors and `NULL` elements are also considered valid conditions.
#'
#' @details
#' This function acts as a simple filter around [is_condition()]. It checks
#' each element of `x` against the column names of `data` and removes those
#' that contain invalid predicates. The result preserves only valid conditions
#' and discards the invalid ones.
#'
#' @param x A list of character vectors, each representing a condition.
#' @param data A matrix or data frame whose column names define valid
#'   predicates.
#'
#' @return A list containing only those elements of `x` that are valid
#'   conditions.
