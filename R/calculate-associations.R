#' Calculate additional interest measures for association rules
#'
#' @description
#' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#'
#' This function calculates various additional interest measures for
#' association rules based on their contingency table counts.
#'
#' @details
#' The input nugget object must contain the columns
#' `pp` (positive antecedent & positive consequent),
#' `pn` (positive antecedent & negative consequent),
#' `np` (negative antecedent & positive consequent), and
#' `nn` (negative antecedent & negative consequent), representing the counts
#' from the contingency table. These columns are typically produced by
#' [dig_associations()] when the `contingency_table` argument is set to `TRUE`.
#'
#' The supported interest measures that can be calculated include:
#' - Founded GUHA (General Unary Hypothesis Automaton) quantifiers:
#'   - `"fi"` - *Founded Implication*, which equals to the `"confidence"` measure
#'     calculated automatically by [dig_associations()].
#'   - `"dfi"` - *Double Founded Implication* computed as \eqn{pp / (pp + pn + np)}
#'   - `"fe"` - *Founded Equivalence* computed as \eqn{(pp + nn) / (pp + pn + np + nn)}
#' - GUHA quantifiers based on binomial tests - these measures require the
#'   additional parameter `p`, which represents the conditional probability of
#'   the consequent being true given that the antecedent is true under the null
#'   hypothesis. The measures are computed as one-sided p-values from the
#'   Clopper-Pearson confidence interval for the binomial proportion:
#'   - `"lci"` - *Lower Critical Implication* computed as
#'     \eqn{\sum_{i=pp}^{pp+pn} \frac{(pp+pn)!}{i!(pp+pn-i)!} p^i (1-p)^{pp+pn-i}}
#'   - `"uci"` - *Upper Critical Implication* computed as
#'     \eqn{\sum_{i=0}^{pp} \frac{(pp+pn)!}{i!(pp+pn-i)!} p^i (1-p)^{pp+pn-i}}
#'   - `"dlci"` - *Double Lower Critical Implication* computed as
#'     \eqn{\sum_{i=pp}^{pp+pn+np} \frac{(pp+pn+np)!}{i!(pp+pn+np-i)!} p^i (1-p)^{pp+pn+np-i}}
#'   - `"duci"` - *Double Upper Critical Implication* computed as
#'     \eqn{\sum_{i=0}^{pp} \frac{(pp+pn+np)!}{i!(pp+pn+np-i)!} p^i (1-p)^{pp+pn+np-i}}
#'   - `"lce"` - *Lower Critical Equivalence* computed as
#'     \eqn{\sum_{i=pp}^{pp+pn+np+nn} \frac{(pp+pn+np+nn)!}{i!(pp+pn+np+nn-i)!} p^i (1-p)^{pp+pn+np+nn-i}}
#'   - `"uce"` - *Upper Critical Equivalence* computed as
#'     \eqn{\sum_{i=0}^{pp} \frac{(pp+pn+np+nn)!}{i!(pp+pn+np+nn-i)!} p^i (1-p)^{pp+pn+np+nn-i}}
#'
#' - measures adopted from the `arules` package:
#'   `r .create_arules_measures_doc()`
#'
#' Many measures are based on the contingency table counts, and some may be
#' undefined for certain combinations of counts (e.g., division by zero).
#' This issue can be mitigated by applying smoothing using the `smooth_counts`
#' argument.
#'
#' @param x A nugget of flavour `associations`, typically created with
#'    [dig_associations()] with argument `contingency_table = TRUE`.
#' @param measures A character vector specifying which interest measures to
#'    calculate. If `NULL` (the default), all supported measures are calculated.
#'    See the Details section for the list of supported measures.
#' @param smooth_counts A non-negative numeric value specifying the amount of
#'    Laplace smoothing to apply to the contingency table counts before
#'    calculating the interest measures. Default is `0` (no smoothing).
#'    Positive values add the specified amount to each of the counts
#'    (`pp`, `pn`, `np`, `nn`), which can help avoid issues with undefined measures
#'    due to zero counts. Use `smooth_counts = 1` for standard Laplace smoothing.
#'    Use `smooth_counts = 0.5` for Haldane-Anscombe smoothing, which is
#'    often used for odds ratio estimation and in chi-squared tests.
#' @param p A numeric value in the range `[0, 1]` representing the conditional
#'    probability of the consequent being true given that the antecedent is
#'    true. This parameter is used in the calculation of GUHA quantifiers
#'    `"lci"`, `"uci"`, `"dlci"`, `"duci"`, `"lce"`, and `"uce"`.
#'    The default value is `0.5`.
#' @param ... Currently unused.
#' @return An S3 object which is an instance of `associations` and `nugget`
#'    classes and which is a tibble containing all the columns of the input
#'    nugget `x`, plus additional columns for each of the requested interest
#'    measures.
