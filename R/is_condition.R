#' Check whether a list of character vectors contains valid conditions
#'
#' A valid condition is a character vector of predicate names, where each
#' predicate corresponds to a column name in a given data frame or matrix.
#' This function verifies that each element of a list `x` contains only valid
#' predicates that match column names of `data`.
#'
#' Special cases:
#' * An empty character vector (`character(0)`) is considered a valid condition
#'   and always passes the check.
#' * A `NULL` element is treated the same as an empty character vector, i.e.,
#'   it is also a valid condition.
#'
#' @param x A list of character vectors, each representing a condition.
#' @param data A matrix or data frame whose column names define valid
#'   predicates.
#'
#' @return A logical vector with one element for each condition in `x`. An
#'   element is `TRUE` if the corresponding condition is valid, i.e. all of its
#'   predicates are column names of `data`. Otherwise, it is `FALSE`.
