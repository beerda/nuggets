Description: Generate conditions in the form of elementary conjunctions, evaluate
    them on a dataset and check the induced sub-data for interesting statistical properties.
    Currently, the package searches for implicative association rules and conditional correlations.
    A user-defined function may be defined to evaluate on each generated condition to search for
    custom patterns.
